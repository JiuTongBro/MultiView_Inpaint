Here we add two more codes to the orginal 'Segment-and-Track-Anything', which supports the segmentation on our results:
```
bash seg.sh {scenename} {casename} {ctrlid} {gpu}
```
The results will be outputed to `gs-simp/inpaint/sam_mask`.

Now jump back to `gs-simp` [directory](https://github.com/JiuTongBro/MultiView_Inpaint/tree/main/gs-simp) and follow the second-stage running.
